# Some example scripts 

Scripts here only demonstrate the general usage of the MultiBand_ImSim pipeline or for reproducing SKiLLS. The configuration file is not necessary to contain all parameters. 

To create a configuration file with all parameters, run

`python ../modules/Run.py 0`

For detailed usage information, run

`python ../modules/Run.py --help`

Do not hesitate to contact [me](https://github.com/lshuns) if you need some customised scripts for your project.
