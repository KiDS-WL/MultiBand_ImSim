# Code for working with metadetection catalogues

[A_assign_weights.py](https://github.com/KiDS-WL/MultiBand_ImSim/tree/main/utils_metadetect/A_assign_weights.py)

- Assigns statistical shear weights to objects in metadetection catalogues, following the approach described in [Sheldon et al. (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023OJAp....6E..17S/abstract).

[B_calculate_R_and_bias_whole.py](https://github.com/KiDS-WL/MultiBand_ImSim/tree/main/utils_metadetect/B_calculate_R_and_bias_whole.py)

- Calculates the shear response for the full sample and estimates residual shear biases.
