Installation instructions for the lensfit suite.
------------------------------------------------

1. The software should be installed on a 64-bit machine.

2. Read the supplied document docs/lensfit.pdf and configure the source
   code as described.

3. Lensfit requires 64-bit versions of libraries to be already installed:

   FFTW v.3 http://www.fftw.org/
   cfitsio  http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/
   GSL      http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

Use the CFLAGS environment variable to specify that the compilation is to 
be 64-bit and to allow the appropriate package include files for the FFTW 
and cfitsio libraries, e.g., in C-shell,

 setenv CFLAGS "-m64 -I/users/miller/cfitsio/include -I/users/miller/fftw/fftw-3.1.2/include"

Also use the environment variable LDFLAGS to set the paths to the FFTW and 
cfitsio libraries, e.g.

 setenv LDFLAGS "-L/Users/miller/cfitsio/lib -L/Users/miller/fftw/fftw-3.1.2/lib"

The configure script uses the GSL utility gsl-config to set up the paths for 
the GSL libraries, so you should ensure that your normal PATH includes the 
path to the gsl-config executable for your 64-bit GSL installation.

If you have specific compilers that you wish to use, specify these also with 
the appropriate environment variable.

4. Build the suite with the following commands

   ./configure --prefix=<install directory>
   make
   make install
